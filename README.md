## XDC 2018

This is the sample application that I modified during my talk for XDC 2018:

*Factoring your application for testability*

It is based on the sample Xojo application "ToDoDesktop".

The presentation itself is included as a PDF inside the "Factoring for testability" folder.

If you are looking for the XDC 2016 version of this app, look for the tag "xdc-2016"
